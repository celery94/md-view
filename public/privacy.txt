Last Updated: 2/12/2026

1. No Data Collection
We respect your privacy. View as Markdown does not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data, browsing history, or website content to any external servers or third parties.

2. How Your Data Is Handled
All processing of web pages happens entirely locally on your device (client-side).

Content Transformation: When you activate the extension, it reads the HTML of the current tab solely to convert it into Markdown format. This data never leaves your browser.

Storage: The extension does not persistently store your data. Once you close the extension or the tab, the converted content is cleared from the extension's memory.

3. Permissions
We request the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to function:

activeTab / scripting: Used strictly to access the content of the specific page you are currently viewing only when you click the extension icon, in order to generate the Markdown view.

4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party analytics (like Google Analytics) or tracking tools.
